# Get User and Organization Reports ðŸ“ˆ with GraphQL
 
The tool will help you get the details of **User**, **User activity** and **Organization details.** Using GraphQL queries, the application access the GitHub's **GraphQL API Endpoints** to create user and organization reports. The main user Input is considered to be name of the organization. With this input, GraphQL queries are sent as a request to generate the response for the reports.

We have 3 queries to fetch **User**, **User activity** and **Organization data**. These queries are sent in a single request to generate the report based on the response received.

## Data populated in the report

### User

- Email
- Company
- Login
- Last Active Contribution

### User Activity

- Login
- Last Active Contribution
- Last Contributed Repository

### Organization Details

- email
- login

## GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. With GraphQL, it is possible to customize responses to match the requests that are submitted. Also many resources can be fetched with a single response. With a single response, many resources can be retrieved. GraphQL implementations are provided by several distinct programming languages including C#, Erlang, Java, PHP etc.

## Why

One of the great benefits is that with a single request, all the data you need can be obtained, however complicated it may be.

## Application Uses
