# Get User and Organization reports ðŸ“ˆ with GraphQL
 
The tool will help you get the details of **User**, **User activity** and **Organization details.** Using GraphQL queries, the application access the GitHub's **GraphQL API Endpoints** to create user and organization reports. The only input required is the name of the GitHub Organization. The Organization name is included with GraphQL queries as part of the request to generate the response for the reports.

We have 3 queries to fetch **User**, **User activity** and **Organization data**. Based on the response received, these queries are sent in a single request to generate the report.

For ease of viewing and analyzing, the JSON response is formatted into excel data and attached to separate excel sheets.

## Data populated in the report

### User

- email
- company
- login
- last active contribution

### User Activity

- login
- last active contribution
- last contributed repository

### Organization Details

- email
- login

## GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. With GraphQL, responses can be tailored to fit the requests which are sent. Also many resources can be fetched with a single response. Many different programming languages support GraphQl implementations including C#, Erlang, Java, PHP etc.

## Why

One of the great benefits is that with a single request, all the data you need can be obtained, however complicated it may be.

## Application Uses

 - No specific access is required as the data fetched is GitHub's public record
 - An overview of the users and organization level data can be seen from the excel report
